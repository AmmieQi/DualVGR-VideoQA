# DualVGR: A Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit for Video Question Answering (DualVGR-VideoQA)
We propose a Dual-Visual Graph Reasoning Unit (DualVGR) which reasons over videos in an end-to-end fashion. The first contribution of our DualVGR is the design of an explainable Query Punishment Module, which can filter out irrelevant visual features through mutiple cycles of reasoning. The second contribution is the proposed Video-based Multi-view Graph Attention Network, which captures the relations between appearance and motion features.
